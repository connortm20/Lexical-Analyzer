Developed on Linux via Microsoft WSL

original make file included (add -std=c++20 to conditions)

No known bugs.

Modeled the basic structure off of our in class example. Used a different approach to skip
white space so I could detect \n and increment a line counter. insead of using <<, it now
iterates every char.
